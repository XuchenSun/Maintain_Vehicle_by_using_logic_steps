Hello everyone!

I believe some logic philosophy is universal in some degree. In my process of maintaining my SUV(Toyota Rav4), I find some similarities about machanic maintenance and software design and develop.

I summarize four important logic steps about my vehicle mantenance.

    1. Identity specific requirements
    2. Analysis requirements and get the suitable and reachable solution
    3. Prepare for tools and place for vehicle maintenance
    4. Maintain vehicles and fix new problems.
    
 ***Identity specific requirements***
 ========================================
 
  The requirement of mantenance is that
  
    solve the shaking of my steering wheel when braking. 
  
  When I drive my car in highway and want to slow down my speed, I use brake padel and I feel some shaking about the steering wheel. At the same time, I did not hear any noisy.
  
  This is a very important step and all works are focusing on implementting the requirements. In fact the requirements about my mantenances are changed. But 
fortunately they are not changed too much. At last, I finish it.
  
  ***Analysis requirements and get the suitable and reachable solution***
  ========================================
 
  At first, I believe this may because my gearbox has issues. But it is not. In fact I have no idea about that. In other words, primarily, I believe this may be normal performance about my vehicle until I feel that I need more strength to push the brake padel. Hopefully,  I use Google and find the problem, that is the brake disc and brake pad has small gaps. The surface of my brake disc is not flat, therefore, when I slow down my speed in highway, the brake liquid push brake pad to brake disc. Then the friction between unflat brake disc and brake pad cause the shaking and has some effects on my steering wheel.
 
  According to the above analysis I get the reachable solution:
       
        1 replace all brake disc
        2 replace all brake pad
        3 replace brake liquid
        4 test the performance of my vehicle
        
        
  ***Prepare for tools and place for vehicle maintenance***
   ===============
   
   Tools
        
            1 OBD2      // get the fault codes of vehicle
            2 car lift   // lift car
            3 new brake pad and disc      // replace all

            4 Torque wrench               // important
            5 Ratchet wrench   (17MM and 21MM)            // necessary
            6 Cross wrench    // remove tires
            7 others things

   Place:
    
           1 my home front parking lot     // although it is not levelï¼Œ it still works.


***Maintain vehicles and fix new problems***
===============

  In this step, I really want to say that oh my god, I meet so many tough problems.
  
  The main logic steps is that:
        
        1 use car lift to lift car up a little         // Because romoving hubcaps need a lot strenth, it is safe for me to lift car up a little. After removing the tire, liftting to a good position is a good idea.
        2 remove hubcaps of a tire
        3 remove tire
        4 use car lift to lift car up to a necessary level

        5 use 17MM to remove two bolts in brake clip and then remove the brake pad

        6 use 21MM to remove brake clip

   ![](https://github.com/XuchenSun/Maintain_Vehicle_by_using_logic_steps/blob/master/brake_clip.jpg)
           
        7 remove brake disc
        8 install new brake disc  
        9 install brake clip      //use torque wrench to install 21mm bolts
        10 install brake pad      //use torque wrench to install 17mm bolts
        11 install tire
        12 install hubcap         //use torque wrench to install hubcap
        13 Lower the car and remove the car lift.
        14 use OBD2 to test

This is the list of new problems:

    1 the car chassis has obvious corrosion         // I use tools to remove the corrosion and paint some car undercover to chassis in order to protecting from corrosion
    2 Some bolts have corrosion and it is hard to remove    // I use WD40 liquid to remove the corrosion and clean it. At last, I use torque wrench to push and then remove it.
    3 some hubcaps are hard to install         // try for many times
    4 one brake disc is hard to remove // it can works, so I keep it
