# Maintain_Vehicle_by_using_logic_steps



I believe some logic philosophy is universal in some degree. In my process of maintaining my SUV(Toyota Rav4), I find some similarities about machanic maintenance and software design and develop.

I summarize four important logic steps about my vehicle mantenance.

    1. Identity specific requirements
    2. Analysis requirements and get the suitable and reachable solution
    3. Prepare for tools and place for vehicle maintenance
    4. Maintain vehicles and fix new problems.
    
 ***Identity specific requirements***
 ========================================
 
  The requirement of mantenance is that
  
    solve the shaking of my steering wheel when braking. 
  
  When I drive my car in highway and want to slow down my speed, I use brake padel and I feel some shaking about the steering wheel. At the same time, I did not hear any noisy.
  
  This is a very important step and all works are focusing on implementting the requirements. In fact the requirements about my mantenances are changed. But 
fortunately they are not changed too much. At last, I finish it.
  
  ***Analysis requirements and get the suitable and reachable solution***
  ========================================+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
 
  At first, I believe this may because my gearbox has issues. But it is not. In fact I have no idea about that. In other words, primarily, I believe this may be normal performance about my vehicle until I feel that I need more strength to push the brake padel. Hopefully,  I use Google and find the problem, that is the brake disc and brake pad has small gaps. The surface of my brake disc is not flat, therefore, when I slow down my speed in highway, the brake liquid push brake pad to brake disc. Then the friction between unflat brake disc and brake pad cause the shaking and has some effects on my steering wheel.
 
  According to the above analysis I get the reachable solution:
       
        1 replace all brake disc
        2 replace all brake pad
        3 replace brake liquid
        4 test the performance of my vehicle
